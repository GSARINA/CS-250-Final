How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?  How does creating "user stories" help with this?
Answer- I would use a product backlog or user stories to create a list of items needed to implement for the product.  Creating user stories provides alignment on what is needed or requested by the client or organization.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Answer- The Scrum process is a great tool to use to develop programs.  I would use phases like planning, design, implementation, testing to help me develop programs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Answer- To be a good team member would require full transparency and clear communication from myself and my team.  If I am not aligned with the goals, then I could jeopardize completion of the product.
Myself and the team have to have personal accountability for each of our roles so it can be easier for the team to grow.
